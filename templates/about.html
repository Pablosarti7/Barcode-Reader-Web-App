            <p>
                Our app is designed to bring a fun twist to grocery shopping. Simply scan the barcode of any food
                item,
                and
                voila! We'll present you with a whimsical interpretation of the ingredients and their so-called
                "impact"
                on your
                health.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Just for Fun</h2>
